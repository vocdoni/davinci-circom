    Transition to BLS12-377 curve support
    
    - Added BLS12-377 specific primitives (Twisted Edwards, MiMC7 matching Gnark).
    - Updated circuits to use BLS12-377 parameters and round counts.
    - Switched Poseidon to MiMC7 for cross-platform compatibility.
    - Updated Go utility library and tests to use gnark-crypto and local snarkjs.
    - Verified all tests pass with the new curve.
